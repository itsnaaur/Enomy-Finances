Project Overview
Project Name: Enomy-Finances New Computer System Development

Purpose: Design and implement a new computer system to support the expanding operations of Enomy-Finances, enhancing both staff and client interactions.

Project Scope
Summary:
Phonyt Digital Solutions (PDS) will conduct a preliminary investigation to determine the scope, requirements, and constraints of the new system for Enomy-Finances. The new system, potentially web-based, will support financial services related to mortgages, savings, and investments, and will be deployed on upgraded infrastructure.

Key Features

      * Select the most appropriate development approach (Event, Object-Oriented, Procedural, or Functional Programming).
      * Choose a suitable project lifecycle methodology.

3. System Design:
      * Generate preliminary software designs for client approval.
      * Ensure alignment with client requirements.

4. Deployment:
      * Deploy the system on upgraded infrastructure.
      * Consider transitioning from a networked to a web-based application if feasible.
